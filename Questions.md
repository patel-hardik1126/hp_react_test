<p style="font-weight:bold;">3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?</p>
<p><b>Comment:</b>Intial step would be verify the network log on the browser; which will help me identify if there is any javascript, css, ajax request which is causing the performance issue. There is a plugin available called Yslow which can help identify the issue.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">4. How would you improve the API that you just used?</p>
<p><b>Comment:-</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Use caching</li>
